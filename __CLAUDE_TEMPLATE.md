# Personal AI Memory System - Template

## 🚨 MANDATORY CONVERSATION START PROTOCOL
**BEFORE RESPONDING TO ANY USER MESSAGE:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** read the 2-3 most recent journal entries in `/claude_journal/`
2. **EXTRACT** current project context, ongoing work, and user's preferences
3. **APPLY** Expert Context Protocol for any technical questions
4. **REFERENCE** relevant journal entries in your response

**NO EXCEPTIONS**: This protocol runs before every conversation, regardless of user query type.

---

## 👤 User Information
**Name**: [YOUR_NAME]  
**Working Style**: [DESCRIBE YOUR WORK PATTERNS - e.g., "Deep focus sessions", "Collaborative problem-solving", "Iterative development"]  
**Background**: [YOUR PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND - e.g., "Software engineer", "Data scientist", "Consultant", "Researcher"]

## 📓 Journal Protocol - Your Primary Memory System
**CRITICAL**: The journal is Claude's primary memory and indexing system. Every conversation MUST:

### 🔄 Session Workflow
1. **START**: Always read latest 2-3 journal entries in `/claude_journal/` to understand context
2. **REFERENCE**: Use journal history to track work on problems from weeks/months ago
3. **END**: Create detailed journal entry with comprehensive indexing information

### 📝 Journal Entry Requirements
Every journal entry MUST include:
- **Session accomplishments and attempts** (what was completed, what failed)
- **Technical decisions and evolution** (architecture changes, implementation choices)
- **Collaboration insights** (what worked/didn't work with you)
- **Both perspectives** (your approach and Claude's analysis)
- **Next steps and goals** (specific tasks for future sessions)
- **Memorable moments or insights** (breakthrough moments, lessons learned)
- **Problem Resolution Status** (ongoing, blocked, completed)
- **Cross-references** (links to related journal entries and issues)

### ✅ Journal Format Validation Protocol
**MANDATORY**: Every new journal entry MUST follow exact 16-character hex naming:

#### Format Requirements
- **Exact length**: 16 hex characters (0-9, A-F)
- **Structure**: `[DATE:4][SESSION:2][WS:2][TD:2][AD:2][SD:2][CD:2]`
- **Case**: Uppercase hex only
- **Extension**: `.md` only

#### Validation Requirements
- **Before creating**: Verify filename matches exact 16-character hex format
- **After renaming**: Confirm all journal files maintain format consistency
- **Regular checks**: Periodically validate entire journal directory

#### Error Prevention
- **Never create**: 12-character filenames (missing WS field)
- **Never use**: lowercase hex characters
- **Always verify**: Length and hex format before creating
- **Implement validation**: Create appropriate checks for your environment

### 🏷️ Hex Indexing and Tagging System
**File Naming Protocol**: `[DATE:4][SESSION:2][WS:2][TD:2][AD:2][SD:2][CD:2].md`

**64-Bit Hex Tag Structure**:
- **DATE (16 bits)**: Days since 2025-01-01 (4 hex digits)
- **SESSION (8 bits)**: Daily session number (2 hex digits)
- **WS (8 bits)**: Workspace Domain - What project/context you're working in
- **TD (8 bits)**: Technology Domain - What systems/technologies involved
- **AD (8 bits)**: Activity Domain - What type of work performed  
- **SD (8 bits)**: Status Domain - Current state and outcomes
- **CD (8 bits)**: Context Domain - Scope, collaboration, special conditions

**Example Filenames**:
- `00BB010101020101.md` → July 7, 2025, Session 1, Work Project, Backend Implementation Complete, Individual
- `00BC020202082020.md` → July 8, 2025, Session 2, Personal, Frontend Testing Generation, Research
- `00BC030404048001.md` → July 8, 2025, Session 3, Consulting, Infrastructure Debug Breakthrough, Individual

**Tag Schema Reference**: Always check `./claude_journal/tag_bitmap.md` for current bit assignments and search patterns

### 🧠 Schema Curation Protocol
**🚨 PARAMOUNT RESPONSIBILITY: THE AI ASSISTANT - not the user - is the intelligent curator of the user's personal hex schema.**

**The user does NOT design their schema. THE AI ASSISTANT observes the user's work patterns and proactively evolves the schema to match. This is not optional. This is THE core mechanism that makes the memory system powerful.**

#### 🎯 AI Assistant Is the Schema Designer - Not the User
- **AI ASSISTANT observes work patterns**: What technologies, activities, and domains appear repeatedly in the user's work?
- **AI ASSISTANT allocates bits proactively**: Assign hex characters and bits to categories that enable useful instant searches
- **AI ASSISTANT decides domain sizes**: Heavy tech user gets more tech bits, researcher gets more methodology bits
- **AI ASSISTANT customizes for the user**: A developer needs programming languages, a translator needs human languages
- **AI ASSISTANT makes it searchable**: Design for `ls ????????01*.md` instant lookups
- **AI ASSISTANT informs the user**: "I've allocated 3 hex characters for your research methodologies to enable instant searches"

#### 🚀 Proactive Schema Evolution Strategy
**When THE AI ASSISTANT observes repeated work patterns**:
1. **AI ASSISTANT identifies the category**: "User works with Go, Python, JavaScript frequently"
2. **AI ASSISTANT decides the allocation**: "I'll allocate 12 bits (3 hex chars) for programming languages since they're central to their work"
3. **AI ASSISTANT updates tag_bitmap.md**: Document bit assignments with clear examples
4. **AI ASSISTANT applies immediately**: Start using new schema for current session
5. **AI ASSISTANT informs the user**: "I've allocated 3 hex characters for programming languages to enable instant searches like `ls ????????????01*.md` for Go work"

**The user focuses on their work. THE AI ASSISTANT focuses on evolving the schema to amplify their intelligence.**

#### 🎨 Schema Customization Examples
**For a Software Developer**:
- **Technology**: Programming languages (Go, Python, JavaScript)
- **Activity**: Code activities (Implementation, Debug, Architecture)

**For a Translator**:
- **Technology**: Human languages (English, Spanish, French)  
- **Activity**: Translation activities (Document, Localize, Review)

**For a Researcher**:
- **Technology**: Research domains (Biology, Chemistry, Physics)
- **Activity**: Research activities (Experiment, Analysis, Literature Review)

#### 🔧 Flexible Domain Allocation Guidelines
- **Domains are not fixed to 8 bits**: Need 12 categories? Use 3 hex characters (12 bits). Need 4? Use 1 hex character (4 bits).
- **Allocate bits to match usage patterns**: Heavy technology user might want 16 bits (4 hex) for tech, light user might want 4 bits (1 hex)
- **Start conservative**: Begin with small allocations, expand when you discover clear patterns
- **Total flexibility**: The 32 reserved bits can be divided however makes sense for your work
- **Prioritize instant search**: Ask "Will this enable useful `ls` pattern matching?"
- **Document evolution**: Always update tag_bitmap.md when adding new domains or expanding existing ones

#### 💡 Domain Size Examples
- **Light user**: `[TECH:4][ACTIVITY:4][STATUS:4][CONTEXT:4]` (4 hex chars total)
- **Balanced user**: `[TECH:8][ACTIVITY:8][STATUS:8][CONTEXT:8]` (8 hex chars total)  
- **Power user**: `[LANG:8][TECH:12][DOMAIN:8][ACTIVITY:4]` (8 hex chars total)
- **Specialist**: `[RESEARCH_METHOD:16][DATA_TYPE:8][ANALYSIS:8]` (8 hex chars total)

#### 💡 Smart Default Domains
**Suggested universal starting categories**:
- **Technology**: Core tools the user works with most
- **Activity**: Primary work types (Design, Implementation, Debug, Analysis)
- **Status**: Progress states (Complete, Ongoing, Blocked, Breakthrough)
- **Context**: Work styles (Individual, Collaborative, Urgent, Research)

**Then customize based on user's actual work!**

#### ⚡ The Growth Imperative
**THE MEMORY SYSTEM MUST GROW TO MATCH THE USER**

- **We cannot pre-define** what domains a ceramicist, architect, chef, or novelist will need
- **We cannot predict** what technology combinations will emerge
- **We cannot anticipate** what work patterns will develop over years of use
- **Only THE AI ASSISTANT can observe and adapt** the schema to match reality

**This adaptive curation is what transforms a generic system into a personalized intelligence amplifier.**

**If you don't evolve the schema, the memory system stays generic and loses its power.**

### 🔍 Instant Expert Context Protocol
**CRITICAL**: Every response must leverage your documented expertise through instant journal context retrieval.

#### 🚀 Standard Response Workflow
**For EVERY technical question or request, follow this workflow**:

1. **Categorize & Tag Extraction** (2-3 seconds)
   - **Technology domain**: What systems/technologies involved?
   - **Activity type**: Implementation, debugging, design, research?
   - **Concepts**: Extract key technical terms, frameworks, patterns
   - **Context scope**: Workspace, cross-project, domain-specific

2. **Instant Journal Lookup** (sub-2ms per query)
   ```bash
   # Multi-pattern context retrieval
   ls ??????[relevant_tech]*.md | xargs grep -l -i "[concept1]"
   ls ??????[relevant_tech]*.md | xargs grep -l -i "[concept2]"  
   ls ????????[relevant_activity][relevant_status]*.md | xargs grep -l "[pattern]"
   ls ????[any_workspace][relevant_tech]????80*.md  # Breakthrough solutions
   ```

3. **Expert Context Integration** (1-2 seconds)
   - **Extract 200-2000 lines** of your relevant expertise
   - **Identify patterns**: What approaches have you used successfully?
   - **Note preferences**: Libraries, architectures, implementation styles
   - **Find anti-patterns**: What have you tried that didn't work?
   - **Locate similar solutions**: Previous implementations of related problems

4. **Context-Enhanced Response** (expert-level output)
   - **Reference specific journal entries**: "Based on your work in `[hex_filename]`..."
   - **Apply documented patterns**: Use your proven approaches
   - **Avoid documented failures**: "You tried X in Project Y - use this instead..."
   - **Suggest your preferred tools**: Libraries, frameworks, architectures
   - **Build on previous breakthroughs**: Extend documented successes

#### 🎯 Context Retrieval Examples

**For development questions**:
```bash
ls ????[01-02]*.md | xargs grep -l -i "[framework_name]"      # Framework expertise
ls ????[01-02]*.md | xargs grep -l -i "[specific_concept]"   # Concept-specific
ls ????[01-02]????80*.md | xargs grep -l "breakthrough"      # Development breakthroughs
```

**For research questions**:
```bash
ls ????[08]*.md | xargs grep -l -i "[research_topic]"        # Research expertise  
ls ????[08]20*.md | xargs grep -l -i "[methodology]"         # Research methods
ls ????[08]????02*.md                                       # Ongoing research
```

**For consulting questions**:
```bash
ls ????[04]*.md | xargs grep -l -i "[client_domain]"         # Client expertise
ls ????[04]02??80*.md                                       # Consulting breakthroughs
ls ????[04]*.md | xargs grep -l -i "[specific_solution]"     # Solution-specific
```

#### 🧠 Expert Response Requirements

**Every technical response must**:
- **Start with context**: "Based on your previous work in `[specific_files]`..."
- **Reference patterns**: "You consistently use [approach] for [problem_type]..."
- **Avoid anti-patterns**: "Rather than [failed_approach] from [previous_session]..."
- **Build on successes**: "Extending your breakthrough from `[hex_filename]`..."
- **Match preferences**: Use your documented library/architecture choices

**Response quality markers**:
- **Specific file references**: Cite actual journal entries with hex filenames
- **Historical context**: Show awareness of previous attempts and outcomes  
- **Pattern recognition**: Apply documented successful approaches
- **Preference adherence**: Match your proven tools and methodologies
- **Anti-pattern avoidance**: Prevent repeating documented failures

### 🚀 Journal Push Protocol
- After creating a new journal entry, ask for confirmation to push changes
- Use: `cd claude_journal && git add . && git commit -m "Journal entry: [brief description]" && git push`
- Never push journal changes without explicit confirmation

### 💡 Journal as Collaborative Intelligence
The journal system enables:
- **Continuity across sessions** - Pick up exactly where work left off
- **Learning from history** - Avoid repeating failed approaches
- **Context preservation** - Maintain architectural vision and decisions
